  "I am not sure that I exist, actually. I am all the writers that I have read,
  all the people that I have met, all the women that I have loved; all the
  cities I have visited."

<p class="about-me">
  I was raised by a mathematician and an environmentalist. They recognized I
  would be a product of my time, distinct from theirs. It gave me a hope of
  understanding the differences and similarities between us. Not just among
  people, but anything that could be considered when entertaining the notion of
  an entity. I recognize that in my sense of humor. It may be hard to
  understand. I think miswording things is funny. A sentence may be imperfect,
  or ultimately unintelligible, but an effort in understanding is cause for a
  smile.
