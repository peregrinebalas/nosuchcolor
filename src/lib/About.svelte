<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="about-me">
  I was raised by a mathematician and an environmentalist. They recognized I
  would be a product of my time, distinct from theirs. It gave me a hope of
  understanding the differences and similarities between us. I recognize that my
  sense of humor may be hard to understand, as I think miswording things is
  funny. A sentence may be imperfect, or ultimately unintelligible, but an
  attempt in understanding is worth a smile.
