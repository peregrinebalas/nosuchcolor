<h1>About Me</h1>

<!-- <img src="" alt="headshot" /> -->

<p class="about-me">
  I was raised by a mathematician and an environmentalist who recognized they
  were a product of their time, distinct from their parents' time. They gave me
  a hope of understanding the differences and similarities between individuals.
  I recognize that my sense of humor may be hard to understand as I think
  miswording things is funny. A sentence may be imperfect, or ultimately
  unintelligible, but an attempt in understanding is worth a smile.
