## About

### TODO

- no such information
  - i.e. "about" section
  - no such name: there is no such color as pink, at least in terms of wavelengths of light. It exists as an optical illusion by mixing reds and purples. These colors are the lowest and highest wavelengths of light the human eye can see. The spectrum of light extends beyond, but the visible segment to humans context is curved in on itself into a circle. This circle is bound together at the ends by pink. There is a fallacy to viewing the spaces where that color is as a human: that the color and the viewer, are both real. In reality, both are illusory. This begs the question to the reader, what are you?
  - include who/what the site is for
- no such person
- no such place
- no such thing
  - gallery?
  - do the thing? i.e. code
- no such host (?)
- no such directory (?)
  - no such file

svelte?

## Setup

### create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

#### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

#### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

#### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
