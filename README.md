## About

### No Such Information

"Descriptor of the Site"

The title is based on the visible spectrum of light to the human eye. Wavelengths of red and purple are what we know as magenta, and many shades of pink. These colors of magenta don't exist on the visible spectrum in isolation, only through the return in the curve on the spectrum do they exist.

Only on the choice to make a public site do I have one. This site is the product of the decision to make one and how to accomlish that. I've attempted to list my sources in this, everything from inspirations to direct influences and sources.

If there is a source you think should be listed that's absent, please navigate to the section for contact and detail with me what I've missed.

Thank you, happy surfing.

### TODO

no such...

- no such name: there is no such color as pink, at least in terms of wavelengths of light. It exists as an optical illusion by mixing reds and purples. These colors are the lowest and highest wavelengths of light the human eye can see. The spectrum of light extends beyond, but the visible segment to humans is curved in on itself into a circle. This circle is bound together at the ends by pink. There is a fallacy to viewing the spaces where that color is as a human: that the color and the viewer, are both real. In reality, both are illusory. This presents the same question to the reader as it does the writer, who are you?
  - include who/what the site is for
- person
- place
- thing
  - gallery?
  - do the thing? i.e. code
- host (?)
- directory (?)
- file
- part
- message
- user
- element
- luck

svelte?

## Setup

### create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

#### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

#### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

#### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
