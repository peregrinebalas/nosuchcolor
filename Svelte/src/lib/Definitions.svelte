    "Infinite space is called the goddess NUIT, while the infinitely small and
    atomic yet omnipresent point is called HADIT. These are unmanifest. One
    conjunction of these infinites is called RA-HOOR-KHUIT, a Unity which both
    includes and heads all things." - Aleister Crowley, Liber IV (part III,
    Magick in theory and practice)

  <p class="about-me">
    I was raised by a mathematician and an environmentalist. They recognized I
    would be a product of my time, distinct from theirs. It gave me a hope of
    understanding the differences and similarities between us. Not just among
    people, but anything that could be considered when entertaining the notion
    of an entity. I recognize that in my sense of humor. It may be hard to
    understand. I think miswording things is funny. A sentence may be imperfect,
    or ultimately unintelligible, but an effort in understanding is cause for a
    smile.
