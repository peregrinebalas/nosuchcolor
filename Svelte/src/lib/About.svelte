    Based on the visible spectrum of light to the human eye, and how wavelengths
    of red and purple are what we know as magenta, or shades of pink. These
    colors of magenta don't exist on the visible spectrum in isolation, only
    through the return in the curve on the spectrum do they exist.

    Only on the choice to make a site do I have one. This site is the product of
    the decision to make one and how to accomlish that. I've attempted to list
    my sources in that, everything from inspirations to direct influences.

    If there is a source you think should be listed that's absent, please

<p class="about-me">
  I was raised by a mathematician and an environmentalist. They recognized I
  would be a product of my time, distinct from theirs. It gave me a hope of
  understanding the differences and similarities between us. Not just among
  people, but anything that could be considered when entertaining the notion of
  an entity. I recognize that in my sense of humor. It may be hard to
  understand. I think miswording things is funny. A sentence may be imperfect,
  or ultimately unintelligible, but an effort in understanding is cause for a
  smile.
